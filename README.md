# UART_tx_driver
 A UART_TX driver, also known as a UART Transmitter driver, is a software component or module that controls the transmission of data over the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface. UART is a commonly used serial communication protocol that allows for the asynchronous transmission of data between devices.  The UART_TX driver is responsible for managing the data transmission process from the microcontroller to an external device connected via the UART interface. It handles tasks such as formatting the data, controlling the timing and synchronization of the transmission, and managing the buffer that holds the data to be sent.
